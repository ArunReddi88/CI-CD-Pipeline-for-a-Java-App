To install OpenSSH Server on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

✅ Install OpenSSH Server
# 1. Update package index
sudo apt update
# 2. Install OpenSSH Server
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
✅ Check SSH Service Status
sudo systemctl status ssh
If it's not active, you can start it with:
sudo systemctl start ssh
Enable it to run at boot:
sudo systemctl enable ssh
✅ Allow SSH through Firewall (optional)
If you’re using ufw:
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
✅ Check SSH Port (default: 22)
To verify SSH is listening:
sudo ss -tuln | grep :22
Sure! Let's break down this command:
🔐 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins@yourdomain.com"
This command generates a new SSH key pair for secure communication (typically between Jenkins and a remote server like EC2).
Here's what each part means:Part	Meaning
ssh-keygen	Command-line tool to generate SSH key pairs (public & private).
-t rsa	Specifies the type of key to create: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), a widely used encryption algorithm.
-b 4096	Bit size of the key. 4096 bits makes the key more secure than the default 2048 bits.
-C "jenkins@yourdomain.com"	Comment added to the key, useful to identify the key later. Often this is an email or purpose label.
✅ What Happens After Running This?
You'll be prompted to save the key:
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa):
You can press Enter to accept the default path or enter a custom name (e.g., jenkins_key).
You'll then get:
A private key: (e.g., id_rsa)
A public key: (e.g., id_rsa.pub)
🔐 Usage Example in Jenkins
Copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) to your remote server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
Store the private key (id_rsa) securely in Jenkins credentials as "SSH Username with Private Key".
